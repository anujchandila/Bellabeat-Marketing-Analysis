# Bellabeat Marketing Analysis

It is the second case study of Google Data Analytics Professional certificate program. Bellabeat is a high-tech  manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The case study requires the analyst to follow the steps of data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act by using Fitbit Fitness Tracker users data. 

**Business Task**: Unlock the new growth opportuities by analyzing the smart device data and gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices to prepare high-level marketing strategy for the company.

**Ask**: To conduct this analysis, I have to examine What are some trends in smart device usage? How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**Prepare**: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius). This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore usersâ€™ habits. The data set is stored in 13 different .csv format and contains data about:
Calories
Intensities
Total Steps
Sleeping Hours
Daily Activity
Heartrate
Weight

To perform analysis, I focused on the following files:

dailyActivity_merged.csv: It contains information about the activity date, total steps, total distance, sedentary active distance, and calories. It contains 940 observation of 15 variables of 33 different users.

sleepDay_merged.csv: It contains information about the sleep day, total sleep records, total minutes asleep and total time in bed. It contains 413 observations of  5 variables of different users. 

weightLogInfo_merged.csv: It contains information about weight logs of different users in Kg and Pounds, as well as the Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of the body corpulence based on the height and weight of the person. It has 67 observations of  8 variables. It has only information about 8 users, which do not represent the overall population, so I did not use it for the analysis.

minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv: It contains information about minute measures of the METs of 33 different users. Basically, METs means Metabolic Equivalents, and they are a way to measure the intensity of activity. 1 MET is the amount of energy you use when you are still. So, an activity of 3 METS is an activity in which you are spending 3 times the amount of energy you would spend staying still. The intensity of activities are classified as follows (according to healthline):

Light activity: < 3 mets
Moderate activity: 3 - 6 mets
Vigorous activity: > 6 mets

It contains 1325580 obs. of  3 variables.


heartrate_seconds_merged.csv: It contains information about the heart rate of different users, which is measured each 5 seconds and contains 2483658 obs. of  3 variables.

In terms of limitations, there is no data provided on age and gender of the users as Bellabeat's target audience is female users.

**Process**: I used R for data cleaning, manipulation and visualization. 
First, I loaded the necessary packages and set my working directory:
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
setwd("~/Downloads/Bellabeat_datset/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dataset_for_analysis")

Then, I imported the different tables of the dat set for analysis:
daily_activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read.csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
METs_minute <- read.csv("minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv")
heartrate_seconds <- read.csv("heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")

**Share Phase**: My recommendations for the business:

1. I believe that Bellabeat has to aim the marketing strategy on the sleeping pattern of people because there is a well known amount of observations with less than 5 hours of sleep. Some problems related to the lack of enough hours of sleep are heart diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression and poor concentration which leads to low performance rate on daily tasks. As, there is a neagtive correlation between sedentary minutes and sleeping time so in this case Bellabeat can work on to create a notifications on people device to motivate them to reach a healthy ratio between active and sedentary time.

2. Bellabeat can also create notifications as a reminder of a proper time to go to bed as it might be the reason that people are just not aware of the time and they probably go to bed late. Other reason might include people go to bed on time but having problems falling asleep on time which cause insomnia. To avoid this, Bellabeat can work on to enforce the good habits through a suggested routine and can sent as a notification. This routine can work as a reminder of not eating heavy meals, doing intense activity and using screens close during the sleeping time. A reminder can be sent to turn on the blue light filter on their device if the use of screen can not be avoided.
